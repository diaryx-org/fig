// scripts/build-wasm.mjs). All the actual parsing/editing/serializing logic
// lives there, identical to the native binaries Homebrew ships.

// --- stdio compatibility shim -------------------------------------------
// `node:wasi` has (at least) two distinct gaps that break stdin/stdout/
// stderr the moment they're anything other than a genuine regular file:
//
// 1. It implements WASI's `fd_write`/`fd_read` by issuing a *positional* fs
//    syscall (`fs.writeSync`/`readSync` with an explicit `position`) against
//    the real fd, so it can track the WASI-spec file cursor independently of
//    the OS's own. Positional I/O only works on seekable fds — regular
//    files — and the OS rejects it with ESPIPE on a pipe or socket. That
//    breaks piping into or out of this CLI (`cat x.yaml | fig get -`,
//    `fig get x.yaml | jq`, `` out=$(fig get x.yaml) ``, or a test
//    harness/CI runner capturing output — all of which use OS pipes),
//    surfacing as a bare `error: WriteFailed`/read failure with no
//    indication it's a plumbing issue rather than a real one. Confirmed
//    empirically: a plain `fs.writeSync(1, buf, 0, buf.length, 0)` throws
//    ESPIPE against a piped stdout, while the non-positional
//    `fs.writeSync(1, buf)` succeeds fine.
//
// The fix originally only proxied pipes/sockets, on the assumption that a
// real regular file and a real TTY both already work with `node:wasi`'s
// direct-fd path. The regular-file half of that held up; the TTY half
// didn't: a *second*, distinct `node:wasi` gap showed up on a real terminal
// — `wasi.start()` returned exit code 1 with zero bytes written to either
// stream, for every action including `help`, which does nothing but print.
// The likely cause is fig's very first call in `main()`
// (`Io.Terminal.Mode.detect`, checking whether stdout/stderr can take color)
// failing against a real TTY fd under `node:wasi`, with Zig's minimal entry
// stub then exiting silently rather than surfacing the error — this sandbox
// never has a real TTY on fd 1/2 (always reports as a Pipe), which is why
// only pipes/sockets were caught and fixed here originally.
//
// Given two independent, unrelated `node:wasi` gaps have now turned up for
// "not a plain regular file," the safer rule is to trust only what's
// actually been proven to work directly: a genuine regular file. Everything
// else (pipe, socket, TTY, character device) gets proxied through a temp
// regular file — which positional I/O (the pipe bug) and, empirically,
// `Io.Terminal.Mode.detect` (the TTY bug — fixed by never handing `node:wasi`
// a real TTY fd at all) both work against reliably. stdout/stderr are
// buffered to temp files during the run and forwarded through Node's
// ordinary `process.stdout`/`process.stderr` writers afterward, once
// `wasi.start()` (synchronous — blocks until the guest's `_start` returns)
// is done. The trade-off: fig's automatic color-on-a-real-terminal detection
// can never see a real TTY through this host, so it always resolves to "no
// color" — use `CLICOLOR_FORCE=1` if you want color output regardless (see
// docs/npm-wasi.md).
//
// stdin is the sharp edge: eagerly draining it (reading until EOF, or until
// the user hits Ctrl-D on a TTY) before starting the guest is only correct
// when the guest is actually going to read stdin — fig's own convention is
// that it does so only when `-` is passed as the file argument (see
// main.zig's per-action `-` handling). Gate the eager read on that: a pipe
// with no writer that closes it (a shell's own stdin passed through as a
// pipe rather than a real TTY — common inside another program, an
// IDE-integrated terminal, tmux, etc.) never reaches EOF, so unconditionally
// draining it hangs forever even for `fig version`, which never touches
// stdin. Confirmed empirically: `node bin/fig.mjs version` with stdin
// attached to an open-but-silent pipe hung indefinitely before this guard
// was added.

// --- WASI rights compatibility shim -------------------------------------
// Zig's wasm32-wasi std lib, when it opens a directory handle to resolve a
// relative path, requests `fs_rights_inheriting` bits that cover directory
// operations (PATH_OPEN, FD_READDIR, PATH_CREATE_FILE, ...) but not the
// regular-file operations (FD_READ, FD_SEEK, FD_WRITE, FD_FILESTAT_GET, ...)
// that a file opened underneath that handle needs. Per the WASI preview1
// spec, a child open's `fs_rights_base` must be a subset of its parent
// directory fd's `fs_rights_inheriting` — so without this shim, EVERY file
// open here is rejected with ENOTCAPABLE (which Zig surfaces as
// `error: AccessDenied`), even though the preopen itself is fine.
//
// This is invisible under wasmtime/wasmer: WASI preview1's rights system was
// deprecated years ago and modern standalone runtimes simply don't enforce
// it. Node's `node:wasi` is the outlier that still checks it faithfully —
// more spec-correct, but it surfaces this gap. Confirmed empirically against
// `zig build wasi`'s output (Zig 0.16.0): every action that touches a file
// (`get`, `set`, `replace`, `rename`, `insert`, `delete`, `comment`, `check`, `fmt`,
// `convert`) fails without this patch and succeeds with it. It's a userspace
// workaround, not a fig code change — the proper fix belongs in Zig's wasi
// posix layer, which this package doesn't vendor.
