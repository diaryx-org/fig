# Tasks

Deferred work, one file per item, each with a `status` of `open`,
`in-progress`, `done` or `dropped`. `contents` above lists every task, open
and closed — the index is the spine, and what is open is a view of it (`dx
tasks`); closing a task is setting its status and naming the commit that
resolved it, not deleting the file and not delisting it. A bug is a task with a repro. Arguments for a change
that may lose are [proposals](/docs/proposals/proposals.md), not tasks.
