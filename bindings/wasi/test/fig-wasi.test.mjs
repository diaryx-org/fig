// non-seekable fds — see the "stdio compatibility shim" comment there), which
// hung forever whenever nothing ever closed that pipe. The fix gates the
// eager read on whether `-` was actually passed. `execFileSync` can't express
// this (it can't leave stdin open-but-unwritten while asserting on a
// timeout), hence the manual `spawn` + race here.
