            \\  target; the other flag group is unused (rejected together).
            \\  Like `get`, it prints the converted result to stdout by default;
            \\  pass --write to write it back to <file> in place instead.

            \\  Whole-file mode (--output): parse the whole file as --input (else the
            \\    extension, else sniffed from its contents) and re-emit it as
            \\    --output, in the target format's house style. A host document

            \\    document to convert to have exactly one root key (see `get --help`'s

            \\    splicing the new fences and re-serialized content in place while
            \\    leaving the surrounding prose byte-identical. The source archetype
            \\    is --embed, else sniffed from the file's own fences (falling back

            \\  --diff: print a unified diff of the change instead of the whole
            \\    converted file. Combine with --write to write AND see what changed.
            \\  --compact / --pretty: single-line vs multi-line output (default pretty).

            \\  --strip-comments: drop comments instead of carrying them across formats.

            \\    natively via a $fig envelope (default --lossy).
