//! The inputs every build helper in `build/` shares, bundled so each `add`
//! entry point takes one `Context` instead of re-threading the same five
//! parameters. Built once in `build.zig` after the target/optimize/strip
//! triple is resolved and the single `build_options` module is created, then
//! handed to `artifacts`, `tools`, `checks` and `tests` in turn.
//!
//! This is a "struct file": the file's top-level *is* the struct, so callers
//! write `const Context = @import("Context.zig");` and take a `ctx: Context`.
