//! fig authoring dialect — block-layer + flow-mode parser. See DESIGN.md for
//! the full grammar; this file implements the "Implied implementation shape":
//! a line splitter (markers/key/value dispatch, inline here rather than a
//! separate pass, since committed values can span many lines), a stack-based
//! block builder (depth counts + header baselines), a recursive-descent flow
//! sub-parser, and the literal-else-string value resolver (`tokenizer.zig`).
//!
//! Construction goes through an intermediate, mutable tree (`PendingContainer`
//! et al.) allocated in a per-parse arena, then converted bottom-up into the
//! immutable `AST` via `AST.Builder` at the end. This makes "navigate to an
//! arbitrary existing path and add a child" (dotted keys, index addressing,
//! header re-entry) tractable without fighting the frozen `Node` array other
//! parsers build directly into.
//!
//! Scope cuts (documented, not silent):
//!   * Of DESIGN.md's WARN diagnostics, the comment-depth-mismatch lint is not
//!     implemented (needs offsets threaded through `PendingComment`), and the
//!     inline-`#`-truncation warn is deliberately skipped (indistinguishable
//!     from an ordinary trailing comment). The rest — the coercion warns, the
//!     indent/marker-count lint, flow-like strings, missing flow commas — are
//!     collected into `Report.warnings` (see `Warning`).
//!   * Comment attachment honors a comment line's own marker depth when
//!     containers close: a comment at (or below) a closing container's child
//!     depth becomes its dangling run; a shallower one stays pending and binds
//!     to the next sibling line as its leading run.
//!   * Line terminators are LF or CRLF: a `\r` immediately before `\n` (or at
//!     EOF) is trivia everywhere — see `atCrlf` — so CRLF documents parse
//!     identically to LF ones. A `\r` elsewhere stays ordinary content bytes.
//!
//! Every built node also carries a source `Span` (see "AST assembly" below) —
//! the foundation `Editor(fig.Language.FIG)` needs to splice edits in place
//! (`edit`/`set`/`insert`/`delete`/`comment`; see `editor_helper.zig`).
//! Whole-container structural ops — `deleteContainer`/`moveContainer`/
//! `reorderContainers`, over the region gather in `editor_helper.zig` — are
//! built on those spans plus `reentry_headers` below.
