`fig` is a Zig library (and CLI) for parsing and editing config files.

```bash
$ fig get config.yaml
hello: world
$ fig comment config.yaml --inline hello "this is a comment"
$ fig get config.yaml
hello: world # this is a comment
$ fig get config.yaml -o jsonc
{
  "hello": "world" // this is a comment
}
$ fig edit config.yaml hello everyone
$ fig get config.yaml -o toml
hello = "everyone" # this is a comment
````

Originally made for [Diaryx](https://diaryx.org),
`fig` was made to edit frontmatter in markdown files without reserializing,
preserving comments and other trivia.
`fig` has since been expanded to include many different kinds of configuration formats:

- YAML (1.2.2 and 1.1)
- JSON (strict, JSONC, JSON5)
- TOML (1.1 and 1.2)
- ZON (Zig Object Notation)
- NestedText (nestedtext.org)
- Java `.properties`
- dotenv `.dotenv`
- INI `.ini`
- Property list `.plist`
- Fig `.figl`, an in-house authoring dialect authored by yours truly!

And has bindings in the following programming languages:

- [Zig](docs/zig.md)
- [Rust](docs/rust.md)
- [Typescript](docs/typescript.md) (experimental)
- C (not tested, but likely works)

## Command-line interface

Download from Github Releases or with Homebrew:

```bash
brew tap diaryx-org/tap
brew install diaryx-org/tap/fig
```

Or run it with no install at all (needs Node 20+; experimental — see
[docs/npm-wasi.md](docs/npm-wasi.md)):

```bash
npx @diaryx/fig-wasi get config.yaml
```

Run `fig help` for instructions for how to use it on your files.

## Planned features

- Styling directives (maintain styling across formats, such as mapping TOML inline->YAML inline)
- More distribution options (depends on user need)
- More bindings (depends on user need)
- Advanced querying capabilties.
  - Filtering nodes
  - Redacting node
  - Multi-match `fig get`
- Structure-aware diff & 3-way merge.
- `fig patch` (config overlays / patch apply, lossless)
- `fig fmt` enhancements (sort keys, dedupe, stable array, etc.)

**In consideration**
- Schema validation (see [fig-schema](https://github.com/diaryx-org/fig-schema))
- LSP enhancements
- $ENV interpolation

## Fine print

**Contibutions**

Contributions are welcome, subject to my approval.

**AI Use**

`fig`, like many deceptively simple systems-level codebases,
require careful thought and intention.
AI tools can generate code rapidly,
often at the cost of this important design thinking.
Therefore, I have chosen to limit the use of AI code generation in this codebase.

I started writing this library by hand (no AI) for my own education,
and for use in my larger project, [Diaryx](https://diaryx.org).
After writing a JSON tokenizer and parser by hand,
and designing the Document, Token, and Language abstractions,
I decided to make use of the Codex AI tool
to generate specific portions of the code that would otherwise require hours of tedious, repetitive work.

Using Codex, I was able to make a compliant YAML parser
much faster than I would have been able to otherwise.
Later, I used Claude Code to do the same for TOML, ZON, and JSON5.
For each of these, I made a conformance suite in order to ensure a correct implementation.

All of the code generated was carefully reviewed and edited according to my taste before being accepted.
I take full responsibility and ownership of the code in this repository.
If you have any questions or concerns about AI use in this project, [please contact me!](<#Contact Me>)

**License**

MIT or Apache 2.0, at your discretion.
If you use `fig` in your work, I would love to hear from you and feature you here!

**Credits**

I took the JSON test suite at `testdata/json` from [Nicolas Seriot's JSONTestSuite repository](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite).
I'm grateful that it is licensed under the MIT license, so I am allowed to use it for `fig`.
A copy of the license is included in this repository at `testdata/json/LICENSE`.

Likewise, test suite licenses are included for JSON5, TOML, YAML, and NestedText
(the latter from [KenKundert/nestedtext_tests](https://github.com/KenKundert/nestedtext_tests), MIT).
I am thankful for each of them.

I am also thankful for the `toml-edit` Rust crate,
which provided inspiration for the complex structural edits required by any format-preserving TOML editor.
