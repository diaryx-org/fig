// The declared half of the Language interface — `Syntax`, `Caps`,
// `CommentStyle`. Every surface-syntax parameter this engine used to select
// with an `if (Language == X)` branch now comes from `Language.syntax(t)`
// instead; see `languages/manifest.zig` and
// `docs/proposals/language-interface.md`. A leaf module, so importing it here
// (and from every `<lang>/<lang>.zig`) pulls in nothing else.
const lang = @import("languages/manifest.zig");

// The OPERATIONS half of the interface — the part `syntax` can't express.
//
// Where a format's editing need is a value (a separator, a marker, whether
// block sequences are editable), it is declared on `Language.syntax` and read
// above. Where it is LOGIC, the format declares a hook: a `pub` decl on its
// `Language` struct named for the operation it takes over. This engine
// dispatches on presence —
//
//     if (@hasDecl(Language, "insertKey")) return Language.insertKey(...);
//
// — so it names no format at all. Each hook's signature is fixed by its one
// call site and documented on the method it overrides; the implementations
// live in `<lang>/editor_helper.zig` (which also holds that language's editor
// tests, so editor-test code sits next to the concern it exercises), and the
// DECLARATION of which operations a format overrides, with the reason, sits in
// the "Editing hooks" block of its `<lang>/<lang>.zig`. See
// `docs/proposals/language-interface.md`.
//
// What remains below is what hook dispatch does not reach:
//
//   * `toml_edit`/`fig_edit` back the EXCLUSIVE operations — the whole-table
//     and whole-container ops only those two formats have, which are `pub fn`s
//     on this struct guarded by `@compileError` rather than hooks. Zig has no
//     conditional container-level declarations (`usingnamespace` was removed
//     in 0.15), so an op cannot un-declare itself for the other ten formats;
//     `@hasDecl(Language, "deleteTable")` on the MANIFEST is the queryable
//     fact, and it costs nothing extra.
//   * `zon_edit.appendFieldName` is reached through `key_style`, as the
//     rendering half of a syntax parameter rather than an operation override.
//   * The bare language tags are used by this file's OWN tests, and by the
//     `Language != Toml`/`!= Fig` guards on those exclusive operations.
