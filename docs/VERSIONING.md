# VERSIONING

`fig` follows SemVer strictly. This means, in practice, that **major releases are not sacred** and will be bumped even on small-size releases if it is functionally a major breaking change according to SemVer.

Therefore, starting with version v2.0.0, the `fig` project now has what some call an "epoch"—a "marketing" version that changes less often than major releases. For v2.0.0, this is "Sierra," a kind of fig fruit.


## Independent versioning

`fig`'s artifacts are versioned independently, each on its own [SemVer](https://semver.org/) track, but **an artifact's version must be ≥ the core version it embeds.** The tracked artifacts:

- the Zig core + C ABI — `.version` in `build.zig.zon`
- the CLI binary — `cli_version` in `build.zig`
- the Rust crate — `[workspace.package] version` in `bindings/rust/Cargo.toml`
- the npm package — `"version"` in `bindings/typescript/package.json`
- the `fig-wasi` npm package — `"version"` in `bindings/wasi/package.json` (a special case: see below)

This guarantees:
- an artifact can never keep an older-looking number while shipping a newer, possibly-incompatible core;
- reading an artifact's version is never an underestimate of the core inside it.

Equality is **not** required — an artifact may run ahead of the core for artifact-only releases. Enforced by `zig build version-floor` (`tools/version-floor.zig`) in CI (via `zig build check`).

The CLI is on this list because its compatibility contract is its own — flags, defaults, exit codes — and is orthogonal to the library API and the C ABI. A CLI-only breaking change (e.g. flipping a flag's default, removing a flag) bumps `cli_version`'s major without forcing a core/ABI release; a core-only change doesn't force a CLI bump either. `fig version` prints both numbers, e.g. `fig 3.0.0 (core 2.0.0 "Sierra")`.

`fig-wasi` (`bindings/wasi/package.json`, the npx-able CLI-over-WASI package) is the one exception to "independent": it's a repackaging of the CLI binary itself — same actions, same compatibility contract — not a separate binding, so its version must equal `cli_version` **exactly** (a pin, not a floor), checked by `version-floor` alongside the `fig-macros` pin (see below).

## The C ABI contract version

`bindings/c/include/fig.h` also defines `FIG_ABI_VERSION` — a monotonic integer, distinct from the marketing version, that identifies the *binary shape* of the C ABI the way an ELF SONAME does. It is bumped **only on a breaking ABI change**. fig's forward-compat design (size-gated structs, decode-unknown enums, add-never-remove functions) makes additions non-breaking, so this number stays put across feature releases and moves only on a true break. The library reports it at runtime via `fig_abi_version()`, so a host that dynamically loads `libfig` can compare it against the `FIG_ABI_VERSION` it compiled with.

Source of truth: `abi_version` in `build.zig`. `zig build abi-check` pins the `fig.h` macro to it; `zig build semver-check` requires it to increment whenever the C ABI diff against the last release tag is breaking. (`semver-check` uses the most recent `core/v*` tag — the core's own release line, see "Release tagging" below — purely as a git revision to diff *against* via `git show <tag>:...`, so it doesn't care what the tag's number itself represents; only `abi_version`/`.version` in the current tree matter to it.)

## Release tagging

Since each artifact versions independently, no single tag number could honestly describe all of them. Instead, each track gets its **own** tag prefix, and a release pushes only the tags for whichever artifact(s) actually moved:

| Tag | Drives | Why it exists |
|---|---|---|
| `cli/v<cli-version>` | `release-binaries.yml` + `homebrew.yml` (build/attach the CLI binaries, create the GitHub Release), `release-npm-wasi.yml`, and `.tangled/workflows/release.yml` (the same binaries, published as artifacts on the tangled.org mirror) | the CLI's own compatibility contract; this is the tag end users actually see and fetch (Homebrew, npx, direct download) |
| `core/v<core-version>` | nothing — no workflow triggers on it | the core has no package registry of its own — `zig fetch`'s "pushing the tag *is* the Zig release" needs a tag that means *core*, and `zig build semver-check`'s ABI diff needs a baseline on the core's own line, so it gets a plain (no CI, no GitHub Release) tag purely as that anchor |
| `rust/v<rust-version>` | `release.yml`'s `crate` job (crates.io: `fig` + `fig-macros`) | also the `cargo-semver-checks` baseline, so the Rust API diff compares against the Rust crate's own release history, not core's or the CLI's |
| `npm/v<npm-version>` | `release-npm.yml` (`@diaryx/fig`, the TS library) | independent track, same reasoning |

`fig-wasi` doesn't get its own prefix — it's pinned exactly to `cli_version` (see above), so it rides the `cli/` tag; its job keeps an explicit "tag matches package version" check (in addition to the floor) to enforce that pin.

Only `cli/*` tags get prebuilt binaries — a GitHub Release object (via `softprops/action-gh-release`) and, on the tangled.org mirror, one `sh.tangled.repo.artifact` record per binary against the same tag — attached. That's the human-facing release. `core/*`, `rust/*`, and `npm/*` are plain git tags (visible under the repo's Tags list, not the Releases page): real, `git describe`-able and `zig fetch`-able anchors for their own consumers, without cluttering the Releases page with entries nobody downloads binaries from.

A release that bumps several artifacts at once just pushes several tags at the same commit — e.g. a release that bumps both the CLI and the core pushes `cli/v3.1.0` and `core/v2.1.0` together; a Rust-only bump pushes only `rust/v1.5.0` and needs no CLI or core tag at all.

## Releasing

One command, which stops before the push:

```
zig build release -- <artifact> <version|major|minor|patch> [...] [--push] [--no-verify]
```

`zig build release -- rust minor` for a Rust-only release; `zig build release --
core minor cli patch` when several artifacts move together. It runs steps 1–6
below in order, and a run without `--push` ends by printing the two commands it
did not run, along with what each tag will set off and the one-line undo (`git
tag -d <tags> && git reset --hard HEAD~1`). The push is asked for explicitly
every time because it is the step that spends a version number: crates.io and
npm can yank a version, never reuse it.

The **release set is read back off the manifests**, not off the arguments — so
an artifact that `version-set` raised to satisfy the `>= core` floor is tagged
and named in the changelog heading along with the one you asked for.

The steps, which are also how to do it by hand:

1. **Preflight.** Refuse a release that is already doomed, before anything is
   written: a dirty tree (the release commit must hold only the bump and the
   changelog), a branch that isn't `main`, a `main` behind `origin/main` (a
   release cut on a stale main is a release missing commits; advisory if origin
   is unreachable), no `git-cliff` on PATH, or a [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) whose
   generated region isn't inside a `## Unreleased` section — which is what a
   previous release cut by hand leaves behind — or is empty, meaning there is
   nothing to release.
2. **Bump** only the artifact(s) whose surface changed, by the amount its SemVer tool demands, with `zig build version-set -- <artifact> <version|major|minor|patch>` (`artifact` = `core`|`cli`|`rust`|`npm`). It edits the right manifest(s) and keeps the coupled fields consistent for you: the `fig-wasi` == `cli_version` pin (so a `cli` bump carries `fig-wasi`), the `fig-macros` pin == the Rust workspace version, and the `artifact >= core` floor (a `core` bump auto-raises any lagging cli/rust/npm), then refreshes the lockfiles. A `core` bump also syncs `fig.md`'s frontmatter `version` field (the number shown at the top of the README) to match, by shelling out to `fig set` itself rather than hand-editing the markdown. Add `--dry-run` to preview the edits without writing — the way to see what a bump would do without cutting anything. (`version-set` is the writer counterpart of the read-only `version-floor` checker; it does **not** touch `abi_version` — see below.)
3. **Verify** with `zig build check` (test + abi-check + semver-check + version-floor + cargo-semver-checks) — all green. This runs *after* the bump, not before: `semver-check` and `version-floor` judge the versions in the tree, so running them first would be judging the versions the release is replacing. `zig build release --no-verify` skips it, for a re-run of a release whose check already passed.
4. **Cut the changelog entry.** `zig build changelog` regenerates [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)'s `## Unreleased` region from the commits since the newest tag on any track; the cut then renames that heading to name every version going out (`## core 2.6.0 · cli 3.5.3 · rust 3.2.0 · npm 2.6.0`), strips the two markers from the section that just became history — so exactly one marker pair is ever in the file and a later regeneration cannot rewrite a released section — and opens a fresh empty `## Unreleased` above it. A handwritten release intro below the end marker rides down with its section. Anything that landed in the **Uncategorised** bucket is a commit whose subject git-conventional could not read; the tool warns rather than refusing, since the region is generated and the fix is an amended subject, not an edit there. Check the **Behavioural changes** section actually covers what an unedited caller will notice — it is gathered from `Behavioural-change:` commit trailers, so a missing one means a commit didn't carry it. `zig build changelog-check` verifies the region is current without writing; it is deliberately not part of `zig build check` (see the comment in `src/build/tools.zig`).
5. **Commit** the bump and the changelog, and nothing else. `release` stages the release files by name and refuses if anything else in the tree changed, then commits as `chore: release <heading>` — a subject `.config/cliff.toml` skips, so the release commit never appears in the next release's changelog.
6. **Tag** one annotated tag per artifact that changed this release (see "Release tagging" above): `cli/v<cli-version>` if the CLI (or `fig-wasi`) moved, `core/v<core-version>` if the core moved, `rust/v<rust-version>` / `npm/v<npm-version>` for those tracks. The SemVer tools each baseline against their own track's most recent tag (`core/v*` for `semver-check`, `rust/v*` for `cargo-semver-checks`).
7. **Push** the branch and the tags — `--push`, or the two commands the tool prints.

If the core had a **breaking** ABI change, bump `FIG_ABI_VERSION` (`abi_version`
in `build.zig`) by hand before releasing — it's a deliberate ABI-contract
decision `semver-check` guards, not a marketing version, so neither
`version-set` nor `release` touches it — and pull every other artifact's major
up to satisfy the floor (`zig build version-set -- core <major>.0.0` does the
pull for you).

Everything `release` does before the push is local and reversible, and any
failure after the bump restores the tree — the preflight proved it was clean, so
`git checkout -- .` puts back exactly what the tool wrote and nothing else. The
one exception is a failure *between* the commit and the last tag: the commit is
left in place and the tool says so, rather than guessing which half to unwind.

## Known gaps

- **No automated TypeScript API guard.** There is no turnkey `cargo-semver-checks` equivalent for the TS public surface, and the C-ABI integer has no TS analog (npm exposes no C ABI). The TS package is on the independent track + floor; an automated TS API-diff (e.g. an `api-extractor` report committed to git) is an optional follow-up.
- **No `publish` command.** `release.yml`'s crate job inlines its own bottom-up
  `cargo publish` loop over the workspace, so the workflow knows the crate list
  rather than asking the repo for it, and a run that dies halfway is finished by
  re-running the workflow rather than a local command. prov's `cargo xtask
  publish` is the shape to copy if that ever needs a manual recovery path.
- **No `npm/*` tag baseline guard yet.** Unlike the C ABI (`semver-check` vs `core/v*`) and the Rust crate (`cargo-semver-checks` vs `rust/v*`), the TS package has no equivalent baseline diff to run against `npm/v*` — see the TypeScript API guard gap above; once that lands, it should baseline the same way.
