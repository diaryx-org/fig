/// This module has two roles, and they are NOT equally permanent:
///
///   1. `Tokenizer` — the shared XML *lexing substrate*. This is the durable
///      part. It is a plain XML lexer with no config-format opinions, and typed
///      XML flavors are built on top of it: `plist` already delegates all lexing
///      here (`../plist/parser.zig`), and future flavors (`.csproj`,
///      `AndroidManifest.xml`, …) are meant to as well. It lives under
///      `languages/xml/` as a neutral home precisely so no single flavor owns it.
///
///   2. `Parser`/`Printer` — the generic XML *fold*, a DEMOTED, best-effort
///      convenience, not a first-class config format. It reads into the shared
///      AST (root is a one-entry mapping, `@`-keys are attributes, `#text` is
///      text content, repeated children round-trip through a `sequence`) and
///      writes back via `Printer`. It is lossy at the edges (no typed scalars —
///      every value prints as text) and shape-constrained (`-o xml` needs a
///      single root key). It IS an `AST.SerializeFormat` member (`.xml`) so
///      `ast.serialize` still routes here, but it is **opt-in and off by default**
///      (`-Dxml=true`), has no in-place editor (`fig edit`/`fig comment` error
///      with `UnsupportedXmlEdit` — deliberately, not "not yet": generic XML's
///      attributes-vs-text-vs-mixed-content edit surface is fundamentally
///      ambiguous in a way a fixed DTD like plist's is not), and is slated for
///      removal as a selectable format in a future major (see
///      `docs/BREAKING-CHANGES.md`). Reach for `plist` (typed, round-trips,
///      editable) for structured XML; the generic fold is only for ad-hoc
///      "get arbitrary XML into JSON" conversions.
